# Project - Cleaning and Analyzing Housing Data

# Project Description
The project aims to clean and analyze housing data. The code performs several transformations on the "housing" table, including cleaning the property address, updating missing values, standardizing "SoldAsVacant" values, and removing duplicate records. These steps aim to improve data quality and enable further analysis.

# Business Challenge
The challenge is to work with housing data and ensure data cleanliness and accuracy for effective analysis. The specific objectives of this project are:

Cleaning Property Address: The project aims to handle missing property addresses by assigning a default value and splitting the address into separate fields for better analysis.

Standardizing SoldAsVacant Values: The project aims to transform "SoldAsVacant" values from 'Y' and 'N' to more meaningful and standardized 'Yes' and 'No' labels.

Removing Duplicate Records: Duplicate records can lead to inaccurate analysis. The project aims to identify and remove duplicate entries based on specific criteria, such as ParcelID, PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, and LegalReference.

By addressing these challenges, the project enables a more accurate and reliable analysis of housing data, which can be beneficial for various purposes, such as market research, investment analysis, and decision-making related to real estate.
